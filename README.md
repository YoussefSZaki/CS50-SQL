These are my personal solutions to the CS50 SQL problem sets. While they pass all `check50` requirements, there may be alternative (and potentially better) approaches.

**Please use these solutions responsibly:**
- ✅ As a reference *after* attempting the problems yourself  
- ✅ To compare approaches *after* submitting your work  
- ✅ To understand different ways to solve the same problem
